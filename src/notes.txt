Workflow: 
    Create the html elements in the DOM for each object dynamically
    Sort each object by status
    Add the styling
    Create a button to edit each task
    Create a button to save the edits
    Create a function to save the changes to the objects using the id as a identifier

Saving the edits to the innerhtml, and then the database later in the course
Make a save button, when clicked update the html with the inputs from the user, just get it from the input field id, also need to use the object id
Function to show the detail view when clicking on one of the tasks and code to exit the detailed view
Add a onclick function to each div and display the detailed information on a styled card according to the figma

Function to allow the user to modify the description etc of the task

Status drop down menu to change the status

Going to need to have some code that updates the array and the html when changes are made, maybe a save changes button

Thoughts for the upcoming functionality:
    Thinking about writing the code to update the objetcs when a user edits their tasks
    Need to update the object itself
    Need to update the innerhtml so it changes with and without the reload
    Need to change the column that the task is in
    Need to make sure that the edited tasks are created dynamicaly into the correct columns etc
    Create a save changes button
    How to increment id when some tasks are deleted/other scenarios

So this works but because the array is hard-coded it does not really work very well, in future update/PUT/Patch the objects themselves when we are using persisting data methods
I would like to do this and then call a function that builds the columns which will update the view with the edits

Modular js files:
    filter methods
    opening the detailed view 
    saving edits 
    closing the detailed view 
    dynamically creating the html elements in the DOM for the task objects 

Modular js - get the html elements once, save into a variable and export import where it needs to be used more than once 
Look into refactor functions using inheritance and prototypes

Look into refactoring using the local storage to share data between the js code instead of import/export (may be a security risk as its saved in the browser)
    Apparentley this is not best practice and this all becomes redundant when using a database and api endpoints

Need to keep in mind that I have not coded enough validation checks to this code, in future I need to check variables and errors etc for debugging purposes

Need to implement checks for the following and more in the user inputs:
    Profanity
    Minimum or maximum length
    Duplicate task titles
    Special characters
    Forbidden words

Stretch goals
    Sort by priority but also by fastest to complete/least amount of time and energy to complete
    I want to add the drag and drop as a stretch goal.
    Maybe add some plotly visuals for certian key areas such as on average how long does a task take to move from todo - doing - todo 
    Maybe add links to the tasks so you can affectivley get to any task immediatley from one place, as you click the link it moves to doing column 
    Track how many times a user clicks on a task and how long the user is working on it (mouse clicks maybe)
    Add the ability to send a alert/alarm to the user so they are reminded to work on certian tasks 
    I would personally benefit more from a app that just remind me to do things vs just tracks the items

A different method for targeting elements, keep in mind for future when class names are being used in multiple places manually
// Card elements/tasks dark mode
    // Select all columns
    //const columns = document.querySelectorAll('#todo-column, #doing-column, #done-column');
    // Loop through each column and toggle the dark mode on each child/card element of each column
    //columns.forEach(column => 
        //column.querySelectorAll(':scope > :not(:first-child), :scope *').forEach(childElement => childElement.classList.toggle('dark-mode-light'))); // Might be easier to just give each created div a classname)
